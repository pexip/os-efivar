efivar (30-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    Upstream screwed up previously with the approach used in version 27 
    and included was making the ABI in the SONAME.  They've fixed this
    in version 28. 
    More can be seen in upstream commit b729026.

    Consequently it will look a little odd to upgrade from
    libefivar0 -> libefivar27 -> libefivar1
    but this is expected.  *27 binary packages shouldn't remain in the
    Debian archive after 30-1 transitions to testing.
